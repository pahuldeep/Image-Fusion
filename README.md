# Image Fusion Application

This application performs image fusion using various methods. 

I will update later.

- IHS method (working)
- MEAN method (working)
- BROVEY method (there is a bug debug later.)
- ESRI method (update later)

## Dependencies

- OpenCV: You need to have OpenCV installed to build and run this application.

## Functionalities

- **Image Fusion**: The application allows you to fuse different bands of images using different fusion methods, such as IHS and Brovey.
- **Save Fused Image**: You can save the fused image to your filesystem.

## Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build and run the application using CMake:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-fusion-app.git
cd image-fusion-app
```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
3. Configure the build with CMake:
```
cmake ..
```
4. Build the application:
```
cmake --build .
```
